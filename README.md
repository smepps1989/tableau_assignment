In March 2024, there were a total of 65,305 riders. Most of the riders had a subscription of some sort with the service. Fridays were the busiest days for rides, however, casual riders mostly chose Sundays to take a ride.

There two options for the type of bike that a user could choose: electric or classic. Most riders chose to ride electrics bikes.

The "Starting Locations" map shows that Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl was the most popular start station with 3,266 total rides beginning there, but the riders who had a membership mostly started at the Grove St. Path station.

Looking at the number of rides by day in March 2024 as seen in the "Total Rides in March 2024" visualization, there was an interesting spike that occurred mid-month, approximately between March 14th and March 18th. Knowing that March is typically a cold month for the upper East Coast, it was discovered that the city was experiencing a heat spike with temperatures reaching the lower 70s on March 15th. During this spike of warm weather, classic bikes were rented the most, but casual riders gravitated more toward the electric bikes.

Finally, it can be noted that although the most popular station that riders used to return their bikes was Grove St. Path, The "Ending Locations" map shows that numerous bikes were taken across the harbor and left at CitiBike stations over there. Because there were no bikes at stations on that side of the harbor represented in the "Starting Locations" map, this could indicate that there is a need to have more bikes available for rent on that side of the harbor, making them more accessible.
